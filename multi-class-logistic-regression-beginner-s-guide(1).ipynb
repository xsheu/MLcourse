In the earlier notebook we had build binary logistic regression as the target variable (i.e. bought_insurance) in insurance data has two classes 1 (bought insurance) and 0 (didn't buy insurance). In this notebook we will talk about multi - class logistic regression.\n","\n","**Multi - class Logistic Regression:** Here the target variable has more than two possible classes/categories. For example, salary of an employee can be categorized as **'low', 'medium' and 'high'**. There are two types of multi - class logistic regression:\n","\n","1. **Multinomial Logistic Regression:**\n","The target variable has three or more classes/categories which are not in any particular order. So, there are three or more nominal categories.\n","Examples: Fruits (apple, mango, orange and banana), profession (e.g., with five groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist)\n","\n","2. **Ordinal Logistic Regression:**\n","The target variable has three or more ordinal categories. So, there is intrinsic order involved with the categories.\n","For example, the student performance can be categorized as poor, average, good and excellent, the salary of an employee can be categorized as **'low', 'medium' and 'high'**\n","\n","## Agenda\n","*  About Dataset\n","*  Loading Libraries and Data\n","*  Understanding the Data\n","*  Separating Input and Output Variables\n","*  Splitting Data into Train and Test Sets\n","*  Build Model\n","*  Prediction\n","*  Check Model Performace\n","\n","\n","## About Dataset\n","I hope all of you guys remembered the wine dataset on which we have done exploratory data analysis.
